<h4>WHEN WOMEN UNITE: THE STORY OF AN UPRISING</h4>
<p>A Documentary By Nata Duvvury and Shabnam Virmani<br>
    Wednesday, the 20th of November at 4p.m.<br>
                       Leavey Library Auditorium<br>
 
    USC</p>
<p>
Shabnam Virmani will be present to introduce the film and participate in
discussion.The film narrates the incredibly moving story of the anti-arrack
(state-supplied distilled liquor) movement that led to the eventual ban
of arrack sales in the Indian state of Andhra Pradesh in 1995.  The movement
started when a group of women participating in a literacy program started
questioning their oppressed status.<br><br>
Spurred into action by the killing of a village woman(who was beaten to death by her drunk husband when she tried to prevent
him from molesting their daughter), they took on the men of the village,
the powerful arrack contractors, and the repressive state machinery in a
valiant struggle that demanded a stop to the endless supply of arrack to
their village (the only village tap dispensed water once in two days
while
the arrack shop received its supplies twice a day). <br><br> The movement took
hold and spread across the state over a period of four hard-fought years.
It was a true grass-roots movement; even today it has no identifiable
leaders. The movie documents the incredible courage of these women, their
political and social consciousness and their steady realization that,
through struggle, they could control their own destiny.<br> <br>The story ends on
a note of such high hope that it chokes you. By the end of the film, you
don't know whether to cry or whoop in delight.  It is a rare story of
faith, commitment and most importantly in these times, of success.
Relevant to progressive movements everywhere, it is a
story that needs telling and retelling.
